;; set org todo keywords, default *ONLY* contain TODO and DONE
;; TODO(t) The item is ready to be done at the earliest opportunity or at the date
;;         (and maybe time) indicated in the SCHEDULED tag. Some tasks are given
;;         a DEADLINE date which is useful for scheduling the tasks during my daily planning.
;; STARTED(s!) I should use this tag when I start on a task, but if I clock in to
;;             a TODO item, I don't really need this task.
;; WAITING(w@/!) I did some work on this task but I am waiting for a response. If I use
;;               this task I schedule the task into the future as a reminder to follow up
;;               with some notes in the body of the task.
;; APPT(a@) Used to tag an activity that can only be done at the specified time and date,
;;          instead of tasks that can be completed at any time.
;; | divide "TODO" sequences and "DONE" sequences
;; DONE(d!) The task is completed.
;; CANCELED(c@/!) I decided not to do this task but have left the task on file with this status.
;; DEFERRED(f@/!) Used to identify a task that will not be activated just yet.
;;                The reason will be included in the task notes.
